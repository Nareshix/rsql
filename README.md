## Installation
Run the following Cargo command in your project directory:
```bash
cargo add lazysql
```
OR

 Go to [LazySql's crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/lazysql) to get the latest version. Add  that to following line to your Cargo.toml:
```toml
lazysql = "*" # Replace the "*" with the latest version
```
## Quick Start

```rust
use lazysql::{LazyConnection, lazy_sql};

#[lazy_sql]
struct AppDatabase {
    // all create tables must be at the top before read/write logic in order to get compile time checks

    // you don't have to import sql! macro. lazy_sql brings with it
    init: sql!("
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
            username TEXT NOT NULL,
            is_active INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (is_active IN (0, 1)) -- the library infers this as bool. more info below
        )
    "),

    // postgres `::` type casting is supported. Alternatively u can use CAST AS syntax
    add_user: sql!("INSERT INTO users (id, username, is_active) VALUES (?::real, ?, ?)"),

    get_active_users: sql!("SELECT id::real, username, is_active as active FROM users WHERE is_active = ?"),
}

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // or LazyConnection::open("path/to/sql.db")  note that it lazily creates one if doesnt exist
    let conn = LazyConnection::open_memory()?;

    // The 'new' constructor is generated automatically
    let mut db = AppDatabase::new(&conn);

    // You can now call the methods and it will run the sql commands
    db.init()?;

    // Types are enforced by Rust
    // Respects type inference. i64 -> f64 for id (first argument)
    db.add_user(0.0, "Alice", true)?;
    db.add_user(1.0, "Bob", false)?;

    // active_users is an iterator
    let active_users = db.get_active_users(true)?;

    for user in active_users {
        // u can access the fields specifically if you want
        // Respects Aliases (is_active -> active)
        let user = user?;
        println!("{} {}, {}", user.active, user.username, user.id); // note user.id is float as we type casted it in the sql stmt
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

---

- `LazySql` has some nice QOL features like hover over to see sql code and good ide support

    ![usage](https://github.com/Nareshix/LazySql/raw/main/amedia_for_readme/usage.gif)


- The type inference system and compile time check also works well for `JOIN`, `CASE` `ctes`, `window function`, `datetime functions` `recursive ctes`, `RETURNING` and more complex scenarios. You can even run `PRAGMA` statements with it.

- Since SQLite defaults to nullable columns, the type inference system defaults to Option<T>. To use concrete types (e.g., String instead of Option<String>), explicitly add **NOT NULL** to your table columns

- It is strongly recommended to use [STRICT tables](https://sqlite.org/stricttables.html) for better compile time guarantees. Recommended to use [WITHOUT ROWID](https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html).

- There will be rare scenarios when a type is impossible to infer. `LazySql` will tell you specifically which binding parameter or expression cannot be inferred and will suggest using type casting via PostgreSQL's `::` operator or standard SQL's `CAST AS`. Note that you can't type cast as `boolean` for now.

  For instance,

  ![error_1](https://github.com/Nareshix/LazySql/blob/main/amedia_for_readme/error_1.png?raw=true)

  ![error_2](https://github.com/Nareshix/LazySql/blob/main/amedia_for_readme/error_2.png?raw=true)

## Connection methods

`lazysql` supports 3 ways to define your schema, depending on your workflow.

### 1. Inline Schema

As seen in the Quick Start. Define tables inside the struct.

```rust
#[lazy_sql]
struct App { ... }
```

### 2. SQL File

Point to a `.sql` file. The compile time checks will be done against this sql file (ensure that there is `CREATE TABLE`). `lazysql` watches this file; if you edit it, rust recompiles automatically to ensure type safety.

```rust
#[lazy_sql("schema.sql")]
// you dont have to create tables. Any read/write sql queries gets compile time guarantees.
struct App { ... }
```

### 3. Live Database

Point to an existing `.db` binary file. `lazysql` inspects the live metadata to validate your queries.

```rust
#[lazy_sql("production_snapshot.db")]
struct App { ... }
```

Note: for method 2 and 3, you can technically CREATE TABLE as well but to ensure that they are taken into consideration for compile time check, add them at the top of your struct

## Features

the `lazy_sql!` macro brings `sql!` and `sql_runtime!` macro. so there is no need to import them. and they can only be used within structs defined with `lazy_sql!`

Note: Both `sql!` and `sql_runtime!` accept only a single SQL statement at a time. Chaining multiple queries with semicolons (;) is not supported and will result in compile time error.

1. ### `sql!` Macro

   Always prefer to use this. It automatically:

   1. **Infers Inputs:** Maps `?` to Rust types (`i64`, `f64`, `String`, `bool`).
   2. **Generates Outputs:** For `SELECT` queries, creates a struct named after the field

2. ### `sql_runtime!` Macro

   Use this only when you need the sql to to be executed at runtime. And there are some additional things to take note of when using this macro

   #### a. `SELECT`

   You can map a query result to any struct by deriving `SqlMapping`.

   `SqlMapping` maps columns by **index**, not by name. The order of fields in your struct **must** match the order of columns in your `SELECT` statement exactly.

   ```rust
   use lazysql::{SqlMapping, LazyConnection, lazy_sql};

   #[derive(Debug, SqlMapping)]
   struct UserStats {
       total: i64,      // Maps to column index 0
       status: String,  // Maps to column index 1
   }

   #[lazy_sql]
   struct Analytics {
       get_stats: sql_runtime!(
           UserStats, // pass in the struct so you can access the fields later
           "SELECT count(*) as total, status
           FROM users
           WHERE id > ? AND login_count >= ?
           GROUP BY status",
           i64, // Maps to 1st '?'
           i64  // Maps to 2nd '?'
       )
   }

   fn foo{
       let conn = LazyConnection::open_memory()?;
       let mut db = Analytics::new(&conn);

       let foo = db.get_stats(100, 5)?;
       for i in foo{
           // i.total and i.status is accessible
       }
   }
   ```

   #### b. No Return Type

   For `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements

   ```rust
   #[lazy_sql]
   struct Logger {
       log: sql_runtime!("INSERT INTO logs (msg, level) VALUES (?, ?)", String, i64)
   }
   // can continue to use it normally.
   ```

3. ### Postgres `::` type casting syntax

   Note: bool type casting is not supported for now

   ```rust
   sql!("SELECT price::text FROM items")

   // Compiles to:
   // "SELECT CAST(price AS TEXT) FROM items"
   ```

4. ### `all()` and `first()` methods for iterators

   - `all()` collects the iterator into a vector. Just a lightweight wrapper around .collect() to prevent adding type hints (Vec<\_>) in code

     ```rust
     let results = db.get_active_users(false)?;
     let collected_results =results.all()?; // returns a Vec of owned  results from the returned rows
     ```

   - `first()` Returns the first row if available, or None if the query returned no results.

     ```rust
     let results = db.get_active_users(false)?;
     let first_result = results.first()?.unwrap(); // returns the first row from the returned rows
     ```
5. ### Transactions
    ```rust
        use lazysql::{LazyConnection, lazy_sql};

        #[lazy_sql]
        struct DB {
            // We add UNIQUE to trigger a real database error later
            init: sql!(
                "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users
                        (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
                        name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL)"
            ),

            add: sql!("INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)"),

            count: sql!("SELECT count(*) as count FROM users"),
        }

        fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
            let conn = LazyConnection::open_memory()?;
            let mut db = DB::new(&conn);
            db.init()?;

            // Successful Transaction (Batch Commit)
            let results = db.transaction(|tx| {
                tx.add("Alice")?;
                tx.add("Bob")?;

                let count = tx.count()?.all()?; // You must convert the iterator into an owned type

                Ok(count) // if you are not returning anything, u should return it as `Ok(())`
            })?;

            println!("{:?}", results[0].count); // prints out '2'

            // Failed Transaction (Automatic Rollback)
            // We try to add Charlie, then add Alice again.
            // Since 'Alice' exists, the second command fails, causing the WHOLE block to revert.
            // If you are running this on ur computer, it is expected to see this in the terminal:
            // "Error: WriteBinding(Step(SqliteFailure { code: 19, error_msg: "UNIQUE constraint failed: users.name" }))"
            db.transaction(|tx| {
                tx.add("Charlie")?; // 1. Writes successfully (pending)
                tx.add("Alice")?; // 2. Fails (Duplicate) -> Triggers Rollback
                Ok(())
            })?;



            Ok(())
        }
    ```

## Type Mapping

| `BOOLEAN`      | `bool`            | Requires `CHECK (col IN (0,1))` or `Check (col = 0 OR col = 1)`. You could technically use `BOOL` or `BOOLEAN` as the data type when creating table (due to sqlite flexible type nature) and it would work as well. But this is discouraged |
| Nullable       | `Option<T>`       | When a column or expr has a possibility of returning `NULL`, this will be returned. its recommended to use `NOT NULL` when creating tables so that ergonomic-wise you don't always have to use Some(T) when adding parameters                   |

## Notes

### Strict INSERT Validation

- Although standard SQL allows inserting any number of columns to a table, lazysql checks INSERT statements at compile time. If you omit any column (except for `AUTOINCREMENT` and `DEFAULT`), code will fail to compile. This means you must either specify all columns explicitly, or use implicit insertion for all columns. This is done to prevent certain runtime errors such as `NOT NULL constraint failed` and more.

### False positives during compile time checks

- I tried my best to support as many sql and sqlite-specific queries as possible. In the extremely rare case of a False positives (valid SQL syntax **fails** or type inference **incorrectly fails**), you can fall back to the `sql_runtime!` macro. Would appreciate it if you could open an issue as well.

### Cannot type cast as Boolean

- This is a limitation of sqlite since it doesn't natively have `boolean` type. I may find some workaround in the future but it's not guaranteed. For now if you want to type cast as bool, u have to type cast it as an `integer` and add either 1 (`TRUE`) or 0 (`False`)

## TODOS

1. [upsert](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/sql-upsert/)
3. check_constarint field in SELECT is ignored for now. maybe in future will make use of this field
4. cant cast as bool
5. BLOBS
6. bulk insert
7. begin immediate
